What is Taboo? 
	Well, folks, Taboo is a turnbased party game originally established by Hasbro in 1989. This version of the game can consist of up to two teams, each taking turns--with the objective of the other team guess the word on the header current card by using the provided additional words on the body. 
	Furthermore, there will be a timer set by default of 120 seconds, that will be alloted to each team. As soon as the timer expires, the teams will alternate, and the cycle would continue. This will continue until a certain score limit is reached, or at the players discretion. 
What does our program do? 
	Our program basically reinterperts the original Taboo game with the inclusion of new topics, as well as with a virtually limitless amount of cards. For this application, we employed the use of the Alchemy API, an API that can take in an URL of a wikipage and break it down intelligently into terms. From that, our program also utilized an ajax solution to retrieve data from the alchemy API.
